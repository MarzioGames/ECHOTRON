# PULSE

> **NEURAL EXTRACTION PROTOCOL · 2041**

PULSE is a minimalist arcade reflex game set in a cyberpunk dystopia. You are CASTIEL — a rogue signal trying to escape a collapsing neural network before the system erases you.

Navigate your operator through an endless stream of expanding rings. Time your orbits. Pass through the gap. Don't get hit. Reach 100 rings and escape.

## Gameplay

Rings expand outward from the center of the screen. Each ring has a gap — pass through it to score. Miss the gap and you lose a life. Lose all three lives and the signal dies.

The game escalates automatically through 5 difficulty tiers:

| Tier | Description |
|---|---|
| `INIT` | Slow rings, wide gaps. Learn the system. |
| `TRACE` | Speed increases. Gaps tighten. |
| `BREACH` | Spinning rings appear. Gaps shrink further. |
| `CRITICAL` | Shrinking gaps. Higher pressure. |
| `HELL_SYNC` | Maximum speed. Minimum mercy. |
